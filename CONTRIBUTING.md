## HACKTOBER FEST Guidelines for October (Updated)

For contributing in October read all these guidelines given below:

* Firstly read the README where we have all the algorithms listed that are added to this repository and please go through our project coding guidelines.

* After deciding which Algorithm and which language **create a pull request** with the code changes and the README index changes. Make sure you **send as PR in the Hacktober fest PR template only**.

* After sending the PR, wait for the response from our side

* PR Review Process
  * Firstly if the PR seems to be valid then it will be labelled as `HacktoberFest21` and with the `specific language label` and will be linked to the `Project` via maintainer
  * If the PR is wrongly sent then it will be marked as `invalid`
  * Secondly after adding the labels if everything seems fine either your PR will be approved or the PR will be marked for Request Changes
  * Before merging the changes the PR will be marked with **hacktoberfest-accepted** label
  * If the requested changes are not done in a week then the PRs will be marked as **hacktoberfest-expiry** and the other PRs which are not merged before 1 November will also be marked as **hacktoberfest-expiry**.

* If you want to check your PRs status you can now check them at our `HacktoberFest project`.
* If someone tries to spam this PR process then the user's PRs will be marked as `spam` and as a community we will make sure you don't participate in HacktoberFest anymore.

## OUTSIDE HACKTOBER FEST (Other than October)

* Before contribution see through repository index and check which Algorithm is missing and in which language.
* For doing the contribution **fork the repository** and **send us an pull request** but make sure you use the **Pull Request template**
* We make sure that pull request is merged ASAP if valid.
